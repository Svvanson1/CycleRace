# CycleRace

In CycleLand Jack and Jelly are two friends. They want to go CycleSchool by a cycle ( Assume that they live in same house). Distance between CycleSchool and their house is 'N' km. Jack and Jelly both like their classmate Jenny. They decided to play a game such that the winner will get a chance to sit with Jenny in school. Rules of game are as follows:
  - Initially Jelly will ride cycle.
  - They will ride cycle one by one.
  - When one is riding cycle other will sit on the carrier of cycle.  
  - In each ride they can ride cycle exactly 1, 2 or 4 km. One cannot ride more than remaining distance.      
  - One who reaches school riding cycle will get a chance to sit with Jenny.
Both play optimally. You have to find who will win this game.
